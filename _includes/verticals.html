  <h1> Threads of investigation </h1>
  <p align="justify" style="padding: 10px 40px 10px 40px"> Innovation emerges most powerfully at the intersections where disciplines overlap, challenge each other, and ultimately reveal deeper structures. Our research spans five foundational verticals: quantum, computation, life, intelligence, and cosmology. We don't perceive them as isolated domains, but layers of a continuous spectrum of emergent systems, ranging from the subatomic to the universal. Each level defines and constrains the next, with rules at smaller scales shaping the behavior of larger systems, and in some cases, the macro informing the micro through principles of inference, simulation, and control. </p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding: 10px 40px 10px 40px"> At the quantum level, we investigate the building blocks of physical reality and the rules that govern their behavior. But quantum mechanics doesn't stop at particles, it informs the design of quantum computers, machines that transcend classical computation. The interpretation of quantum mechanics, especially the role of observers, directly intersects with the study of intelligence and agency. How an observer collapses a wavefunction raises deep questions about consciousness and measurement, linking quantum theory with theories of mind and machine. </p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding: 10px 40px 10px 40px"> In computation, we explore both the limits and the creative potentials of algorithms. Universal computability, computational and algorithmic complexity theory frame what is computable in our universe. But what happens when we replace abstract automaton with embodied agents or physical systems? Concepts from artificial life, such as self-replicating automata, minimal genomes, and digital evolution, challenges our naive understanding of life via computational processes in software and hardware. </p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding: 10px 40px 10px 40px"> Artificial general intelligence occupies the crossroads of computation and life, where adaptive agents must not only solve tasks but also modify their internal structures and goals. Reinforcement learning, a framework born in psychology and matured in machine learning, models how intelligent systems learn from interaction with an environmentâ€”paralleling the adaptive behaviors seen in biological evolution and neural computation. </p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding: 10px 40px 10px 40px"> Finally, cosmology provides the ultimate testbed for our theories. Quantum cosmology, for instance, seeks to apply quantum principles to the entire universe, demanding new mathematical frameworks, and possibly new notions of observers and information. The structure of the cosmos may encode computational limits, inform the conditions necessary for life, and even constrain the emergence of intelligence. </p>
  <p align="justify" style="padding: 10px 40px 10px 40px"> By connecting these verticals, our research aims to uncover unifying principles, patterns of emergence, information, and agency, that cut across scale and substrate. This synthesis is what fuels us - where the quantum informs the computational, where computation simulates life, where life bootstraps intelligence, and where intelligence reflects back on the cosmos that gave rise to it. </p>
